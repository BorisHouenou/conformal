# Conformal Inference Project

This project contains software tools for conformal inference. The current 
emphasis is on conformal prediction in regression. Soon, we will add tools
for density estimation and classification.

The folder "conformalInference" can be installed as an R package, providing
access to the software tools, and the file "conformalInference.pdf" contains 
documentation. 

The folder "examples" contains R code to reproduces all examples in the paper
"Distribution-Free Predictive Inference for Regression". This R code relies on
the "conformalInference" R package.
