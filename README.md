# Conformal inference project

This project contains software tools for conformal inference. The current 
emphasis is on regression tools. Soon, we will add tools for density 
estimation and classification.

The folder "conformalInference" can be installed as an R package, providing
access to the software tools, and the file "conformalInference.pdf" contains 
documentation. 

The folder "simulations" contains R code to reproduces all simulations and 
figures in the paper "Distribution-Free Predictive Inference for Regression"
(referenced below). This R code relies on the "conformalInference" R package.
